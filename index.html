<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>Hello there! I'm a freshman at University at Buffalo and I'm majoring in Computer Science. I've always wanted to create something that I could be proud to call my own. Programming is one way that I could do this, so I'm trying it out. I have some programming experience from high school where I took two classes where I programmed in Visual Basic.</h3>
